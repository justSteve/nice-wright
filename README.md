# myStuff

This is the root workspace for a composite system of applications, learning environments, and research projects.

## Project Structure

The projects in this workspace share a common framework and are organized as siblings under this root.

### Hierarchy

- **`c:\myStuff\`** (Root)
    - **`IDEasPlatform\`** (IAP): The initial project.
    - **`dspy\`** (DSPy): A learning/sandbox environment for the DSPy framework.
    - *[Future Projects]*: Will be added as siblings here.

## Common Layers

Each project typically consists of the following layers:

1.  **Implementation**: Conventional application programming targeting specific features.
2.  **Sandbox/Learning**: Environments for experimentation, training, and exploring the domain.
3.  **Context/Marketing**: Research, backgrounders, and marketing material for the domain.

## Goals

The ultimate goal of this composite system is to service:
- Code-based implementation
- Training in that codebase
- Consulting and/or marketing

## Agent Instructions

When working in this workspace, always treat `c:\myStuff` as the root context. Cross-project references should be made relative to this root.

We are in intial stages of implementation and are still working out how the development enviornment works. Agents should be on the look out for problems and TODOs related to easing User/Agent friction until this paragraph is removed.
